SYNOPSIS
     fox [file ...]

DESCRIPTION
     Join foxified files to standard output.

     With no file, or when file is -, read from the standard input.

FOX TRANSLATION RULES
     fox translates arbitrary unicode runes into fox screams!  See the follow‚Äê
     ing enumeration on how each scream is generated.

     a
       Quiet squeaks are emitted for any lowercase letter.

     A
       Loud screams will be emitted for for any uppercase or titlecase letter.

     !
       Foxes do scream. Other punctuation than exclamation marks are unneces‚Äê
       sary.

     ü¶ä
       Symbols (and other emojis!) are replaced with foxes. Foxes are every‚Äê
       where!

     ?
       The fox gets confused if they encounter an unknown symbol, such as a
       number.

     Linebreaks a are left intact, other whitespaces are replaces with spaces.

     Process text from standard input:

           $ echo "I am a cheetah. üêÜ" | fox
           A aa a aaaaaaa! ü¶ä

     First read the file arctic, then standard input and finally the file cor‚Äê
     sac:

           $ fox arctic - corsac

       Everything is fine. Yerf!

     1
       Cannot not open file. Aaaaa!

     2
       Cannot read file after opening it successfully. AAAAA!

BUGS

     ers.
